
This Python script processes a CSV file to calculate the total paid views for each month and year. 

### Key Features

* **Calculates Month and Year Sums**: Processes a CSV file containing `Calendar_Week` and `Paid_Views` columns.
* **Handles Date and Value Errors**: Catches errors during date parsing and value conversion, preventing script crashes.
* **Efficient Grouping**: Groups paid views by unique month and year for clear reporting.

### How It Works

1. **Reads CSV Data**: Opens the specified CSV file and iterates through each line.
    * Identifies the columns containing `Calendar_Week` and `Paid_Views` data.

2. **Processes Each Row**:
    * Converts the `Calendar_Week` value into a `datetime` object for date manipulation.
    * Extracts the year and month from the date for grouping data.
    * Accumulates the `Paid_Views` value for each unique month and year combination within a dictionary.
    * Tracks processed dates to avoid duplicate calculations.

3. **Error Handling**: Handles potential errors during:
    * Date parsing from the `Calendar_Week` column.
    * Conversion of `Paid_Views` values to numerical data (assumes numerical format).

4. **Summarizes Results**: Prints the final calculated sums of paid views categorized by month and year.

### Usage

1. **CSV File Location**: Place your CSV file in a convenient location on your system.
2. **Script Modification**: Update the `file_path` variable within the script to match the path of your CSV file.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to view the calculated paid views grouped by month and year.
